Ingredients:
 - 1 bunch chopped fresh cilantro
 - 6 tablespoons pine nuts
 - 1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste 
 - 1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese
 - salt and ground black pepper to taste
 - 1/2 cup olive oil
 - 1 (12 ounce) package dry tagliatelle or wide fettucine pasta
 - 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
1. Place the cilantro, pine nuts, lemon juice, feta cheese, salt, and black pepper into the work
bowl of a food processor, and pulse several times to mince the ingredients. Drizzle in 1/2 cup
of olive oil with the machine running, and process until the pesto is a slightly textured paste.

2. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the
water is boiling, stir in the tagliatelle pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered,
stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 8
minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.

3. Place the cooked pasta into a large serving bowl, and toss with the pesto. Drizzle a bit of
extra-virgin olive oil over the pasta, and serve hot.
